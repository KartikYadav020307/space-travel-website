# Self-Designed ISRO Recreation
#### Video Demo:  <https://youtu.be/pLBpBU_wpM4>
## Description
#### Basically, I have designed a recreation of the ISRO website. I have included 4 TABS:
#### **00 HOME**: It is the Homepage, which leads the way to the other pages.
#### **01 MISSIONS**: This tab features 4 missions which, ISRO has completed.
#### **02 CREW**: It introduces you to 4 of the excellent members of ISRO.
#### **03 TECHNOLOGY**: This tab gives you a brief to some of the tech used by Space Organisations.
####
## Special features:
1. The Homepage: It has a special button, which when clicked, leads to the first page.
2. It also features a [SKIP TO MAIN CONTENT] button.
3. In the 02 CREW page, I have used different (button sub-page changers), which can be clicked to change the sub-pages
4. My website is device width adjustable (window can be resized and checked!!)
5. When the width is similar to mobile phones, then the Tabs get in right side pop-up which opens with the (3 LINES) button in the top right.
6. Also, when the website is resize of phone width, the content aligns itself in the vertical position and is quite appealing.
7. And finally, the fact that all pages have their own different background pictures.
## How to operate my website:
1. First head over to the homepage, and hit the big white button which says "Let's Dive In".
2. The button would lead you to the **_01: MISSIONS_** page of the website.
3. The Missions page would contain 4 subpages: **_Moon Mars Astrosat Sun_**
4. The Moon page contains the information about the *The Chandrayaan Missions*, which ISRO completed.
5. The Mars Page contains information about the *Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM)*, which was the mission to Mars.
6. The *ASTROSAT* page contains information about the Astrosat Geographical & Tactical Satellite.
7. And finally, the *SUN* page contains the information about the Aaditya L-1 satellite, which is a supposed mission near the Sun.
8. Then, move on the **_02: Crew_** page, which features the 4 important personalities  at ISRO.
9. The first one is the founder of ISRO, Vikram Sarabhai.
10. The second one is the chief of isro, S. Somnath.
11. The third one is one of main scientists, K. Radhakrishnan.
12. And finally, the last one is the Director of Space Application Centre, Tapan Mishra.
13. Now, lets move on the **_03 Technology_**.
14. It is the page, which displays the technologies used, in launching a space shuttle and all.
15. The First page, tells us about the Capsule.
16. The Second page tells us about the Spaceport.
17. The Third page tells us about the Launch Vehicle.
